# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard

Power BI | SQL | Data Analysis | Digital Marketing Analytics

This project showcases a complete analytics pipeline for evaluating the performance of a digital marketing campaign — from data preparation and SQL exploration to the development of a fully interactive Power BI dashboard for insights and decision-making.

🧪 SQL Exploration

Before building the dashboard, the dataset was explored and validated using SQL queries.
This step ensured data quality, correct KPI calculations, and understanding of campaign performance.

All SQL queries used in the project are available in:

➡ sql_queries.sql

🚀 Project Overview

Digital marketing campaigns generate massive amounts of data, but without structured analysis, extracting insights becomes difficult.
This project solves that by building an end-to-end analytical workflow:

✔ Cleaning and preparing the data

✔ Exploratory SQL analysis

✔ KPI calculation (Spend, Impressions, CTR, CPA, Clicks)

✔ Segmentation by Age Range & Ad Metrics

✔ Final interactive dashboard in Power BI
