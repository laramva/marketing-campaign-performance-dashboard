# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard

A full data analysis pipeline built to evaluate the performance of a digital marketing campaign — from SQL exploration to the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights and decision-making.

This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio and demonstrates my ability to work with data extraction, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and communication of results.

## 🧪 SQL Exploration

Before building the dashboard, the raw dataset was explored and validated using SQL queries:

- Investigated impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, and CTR  
- Aggregated performance by **age range** and **gender**  
- Identified segments with the best cost-per-acquisition (CPA)  
- Validated data quality and ensured metric consistency  

All SQL queries used in this project are available here:
